# footprints-backend-V2

Backend for [footprints](https://footprintz.netlify.app/) made with Django, django-rest, knox for authentication and cloudinary for media host.

# Welcome to My Footprints Backend
This backend is built using Django, a Python web framework for building web applications. It also utilizes Django REST framework for creating APIs, Django REST Knox for handling authentication, and Cloudinary for hosting user-uploaded media files.

To get started, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine. Then, clone the repository and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all of the dependencies.

You will also need to sign up for an account on Cloudinary in order to use the app.

To run the server, run python manage.py runserver in the root directory of the project. This will start the server on http://localhost:8000/ and will automatically reload the page when changes are made.

Please note that this is a mock online backend and to see front-end code go [here](https://github.com/psk-98/footprints/tree/v2) and to see it [live](https://footprintz.netlify.app) 

Thank you for visiting my online backend! I hope you find it useful in building your own project with similar stack.
